# 🛠️ Tweaks for games running on Linux

Tweaks that I've encountered or found myself, in games running native on Linux, or through Wine/Proton.

## 📌 Notes

- Although I created this repository for myself, you might still find it helpful.
- All this is being tested under CachyOS with the RX 9070 XT.
- I have no idea how GitHub works, or what I'm doing.
